Here’s a **single `README.md` file** for your **Role-Based Task Tracker** PHP project. It assumes a basic local XAMPP setup with MySQL.

# Role-Based Task Tracker

A simple PHP & MySQL task tracking system with role-based access. Users can sign up as `admin` or `member`, assign tasks, update task statuses, and manage tasks through a responsive Bootstrap UI.

## Features

- User signup & login with role selection (admin/member)
- Task creation, assignment, editing, and deletion (only by task creator)
- Task status updates (by assignee)
- Role-based task views
- Bootstrap 5 UI

## Requirements

- PHP >= 7.4
- MySQL
- XAMPP/LAMP/WAMP (for local development)

## Database Setup

1. Create a database named `role_task_tracker`.
2. Run the following SQL to create required tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `users` (
  `id` int AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  `name` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  `email` varchar(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  `password` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `role` enum('admin','member') NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE `tasks` (
  `id` int AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  `title` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `description` text,
  `assignee_id` int,
  `creator_id` int,
  `status` enum('Pending','In Progress','Done') DEFAULT 'Pending',
  FOREIGN KEY (`assignee_id`) REFERENCES users(`id`) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (`creator_id`) REFERENCES users(`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
````

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Place the project folder in `htdocs` (XAMPP) or your server's root.
3. Start Apache and MySQL using XAMPP control panel.
4. Access the app via:
   [http://localhost/role-task-tracker/index.php](http://localhost/role-task-tracker/index.php)

## Usage

* Visit the app in browser.
* Create a new user (Admin or Member).
* Log in using your credentials.
* Admin/Member can create tasks and assign them to others.
* Assigned users can update the task status.
* Creators can edit or delete their tasks.

## File Structure

* `index.php` — Main application file (contains logic + UI)
* `README.md` — Project documentation

## Security Notes

* Passwords are hashed using `password_hash()` and verified using `password_verify()`.
* Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
* Session-based authentication for managing user state.

## License

This project is open-source and available for any personal or educational use.

Let me know if you'd like this README saved in a downloadable file or want to split the logic/UI into multiple PHP files for better organization.
